## todo.txt implementation in haskell

This is a simple implementation of the [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) file
format in haskell.
The main purpose of this is as an excercise in learning haskell, this software
is currently
not intended for day to day use, but since it might be useful for some
people I'm making it available.

Even though I'm not planning on developing this actively for much longer, pull
requests of your changes are
welcome.
